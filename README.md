ML-NLP-GenAI

Welcome to the **ML-NLP-GenAI** repository! This repo serves as a central hub for all my projects, experiments, notebooks, and learning materials related to **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Generative AI (GenAI)** throughout my **MSDS (Master of Science in Data Science)** journey.

📌 Purpose

This repository documents my growth and contributions in the domains of:

- **Machine Learning** – including traditional ML algorithms, supervised & unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and pipelines.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – from text preprocessing and sentiment analysis to advanced transformer models.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)** – including applications of large language models (LLMs), generative text/image models, and prompt engineering.
